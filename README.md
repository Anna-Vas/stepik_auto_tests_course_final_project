# Stepik Auto tests course - Final project
This repository contains my final project from the stepik course Testing Automatization using Selenium and Python.

It is a set of tests for an internet store (a special website which is provided by the authors of the course). These tests allow to check if a guest or a registered user can add products to cart and this process happens in a correct way, if a guest can go to the login page, if the cart is empty before we add anything, etc.

For creating this project I used Python (version 3.7.5) and such major instruments as Selenium Webdriver and Pytest (version 7.1.2).

This project was developed within the framework of this course on Stepik: https://stepik.org/course/575/syllabus

I highly recommend this course to everyone who wants to improve their skills in web testing using Python and Selenium.

**P.s. for the rewievers from Stepik**. I'm using the word "cart" instead of "basket" in some tests/classes/methods names because I'm more used to this name and I didn't want to change it everywhere when I noticed the word "basket" in some tests names from the task on the website. Hope this formal discrepancy will not become a reason for my points to be reduced. Thank you :)
